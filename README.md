Functions for performing statistical summaries of data typical to my work at Chapin Hall. This includes doing many descriptive summary calculations of many fields, with many "by"s, in a rapid way using data.table. Other functions flexibly generate parallel descriptive summaries for benchmark populations.

This is a repository to store my first attempts a making a package of these R functions.
